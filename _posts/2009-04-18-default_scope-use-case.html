title: default_scope use case
---

Ryan Bate in <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/152-rails-2-3-extras">rails 2.3 extras episode</a> throws 2 sugestions on when to use default_scope (which is a sort of global named_scope, that can be overriden).<br /><ol><li> default_scope :conditions => "deleted_at is not NULL"</li><li>default_scope :order => "position DESC"</li></ol><br />Ok thats fine but recently i've come up with a more interesting use.<br /><br />I've built an online payment system for <a href="http://photo.charliechaplin.com/">chaplin's image bank</a> and going through all the hastle of getting ssl certificate, a new ip for the subdomain etc etc it certenly not something I wanted to repeat. (BTW thanks again to Ryan bates for the great serie of episodes on paypal). Well since I would be using it for other parts of charliechaplin.com domain I decided to share the payment table, invoice table and user table through differant rails application. That way I could also have an app gathering all the info for budget management.<br /><br />Yes <a href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/gregory/rails_modularity_1.html">Rails modularization</a> is definitely one aspect of the framework I was eager to explore at some point specially when it came to membership. However you still need to know if a payment comes from the image bank app, or the live perfomance app, or the funny hat app.<br /><br />So instead of using STI with the risk of breaking things by renaming Payment with PhotoPayment or something, i brought default_scope in the game along with a before_save (or before_create if you prefer)<br /><br /><br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/94337.js"></script><br /><br />And voil√†, nothing else to change.<br /><br />Charly
